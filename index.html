            <p>BFM's mother is a saint: a decorated veteran, school teacher, and world-class chef. Having served in the US Navy as a Sous-Chef, Master Chief Sugar Belle Sweet earned a Presidential Medal of Awesomeness for cooking up this recipe for President Tony Stark. At the cool age of 32, she left the military to serve her community as a chemistry teacher. That's because she had an obsession with nuclear reactions (her father having been a professor of physics at the University of Stephen Hawking). She called her most successful dish "The Atom" because it was her first cake recipe <em>ever</em>. When she returned to her hometown, she married her college sweetheart, Brandon Biggest: a local insurance agent. They have 300 children--all of them legendary.</p>
            <p>This is one <em>delectably</em>, heart-poundingly sweet dish served chilled: layered in succulent, southern style vanilla cream. It'll have you and your guests asking for seconds, thirds, and...well, you get the picture. President Stark finished an entire cake by himself. He was so pleased with the cake he threatened to issue an executive order making it a criminal offense to eat the cake without thanking God Almighty. Fortunately, he settled for a cup of coffee instead of pen and paper--2 hours later falling into a food coma that lasted three days. Vice President Yoda complained that Stark should have resisted. Stark commented he didn't follow the Force, only science. They remained friends despite their petty feuds.     
            </p>
            <p>This modest dish contains 2,900 calories* per serving.

                This is by far one of Big Fat Mase's favs! His momma started making these when he played football back in high school (that's when he really started getting big because he needed to stop everyone he could on the field). Nicknamed 'The Crusher', when BFM took the field, it was said he could smell a pizza from a mile away (courtesy of his Daddy--an insurance salesmen) waiting for him after each game--regardless win or lose! 
                You'll be packing them Southern thighs with this bad boy. Each serving contains a <em>heavy</em> 4,700 calories!*

    <p class="steps"><b>Step 1:</b> First, say a prayer. After you say "amen" immediately dump all of the ingredients into a large wooden bowl. Preheat oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (400â„‰).  
</p>
    <p class="steps"><b>Step 2:</b> Once the ingredients are inside the bowl, mix them together with a spatula. Use a whipping motion to liquify the ingredients.
</p>
    <p class="steps"><b>Step 3:</b> Okay, now dump the ingredients in a shallow cake pan. 
</p>
    <p class="steps"><b>Step 4:</b> Using the magic wand, tap on the cake pan two times. 
</p>
 <p class="steps"><b>Step 5:</b> Now, say the words, "Shazam! Bam! Wham! Magic Wand, make the cake perfect in this pan!"
</p>
 <p class="steps"><b>Step 6:</b> Perfecto! Wait 15 minutes. 
</p>
 <p class="steps"><b>Step 7:</b> Carefully place the cake in the oven. Be sure to wear oven mits/gloves so you don't burn yourself :) 
</p>
 <p class="steps"><b>Step 8:</b> Let the cake bake for 20 minutes or until covered in caramel colored crust. 
</p>
 <p class="steps"><b>Step 9: Carefully remove the cake from the oven and let sit for 15 minutes before serving.</b>
</p>
 <p class="steps"><b>Step 10:</b> Enjoy the love and praise you will receive from your guests. Or, if you're like BFM, just eat the whole cake by yourself. Hasta pronto, amigos!
